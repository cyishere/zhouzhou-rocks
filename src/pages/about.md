Hello you! It is lovely to see you here! I am Zhou Zhou.

I was born in Hunan, China. MA, I graduated from the Beijing Film Academy as a Screenwriting & Film Studies major.

I'm still learning.

I am looking forward to a writing career and have written several scripts.

Back to writing, here are some of the things I've done：

* "Time Difference", “Beijing Solstice"(both are screenplays for cross-cultural feature films) and " ‘Always Be’, "have won awards in China Film Administration’s script competitions.
* The short film “Taste of Home" won the gold medal in the 14th Shandong Short Film Competition.
* Co-wrote"Say My Name", a short film directed by Ng Chun-Yu and released in 2021.
* Feature Film Screenplay "Lost in Years" was short-listed for The Elite project+screenwriting workshop by Wanda Pictures.
* Always Be was selected for the PPP unit of the Pingyao International Film Festival 2022.

*If you are interested in those stories, please contact me without hesitating. Some of my work's longlines/synopsis will be shown on the Portfolio page.* ❤️
