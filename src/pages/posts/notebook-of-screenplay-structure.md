Many people produce scripts using the "formula of some screenplay structure," such as Blake Snyder's beat sheet, Syd Field's structure, or Robert McKee's structure; they're highly useful, especially for new writers. You can find the most important and key points to build the entire plot and how to drive the characters from beginning to end.

I gathered them together in order to find them quickly.

**A. Syd Field's structure**

Syd Field's structure is a three-act structure, as is Snyder's.

This depicts the main character's actions and changes.

This is the most well-known beat sheet; it indicates when anything will happen.

**C. The five-part structure**

It appears to be a five-act structure, so I dubbed it five parts. BFA taught it to me.

The professor always emphasized that the climax MUST pay off the entanglements. Quite conducive.
