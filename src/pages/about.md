Hello you! How wonderful to meet you here! I am Zhou Zhou.

I was born in Hunan, China. MA, I recently graduated from Beijing Film Academy as a Screenwriting & Film studies major.

I'm still learning. 

I am looking forward to a writing career and have written several scripts. 

And, Super excited to finish my short film shooting in August! That shortening the distance between visual and screenplay, is very helpful! I hope it will be shown! Yeah！ 

Back to  writing, here are some of the things I've done：

* "Time Difference" and “Beijing Solstice"(both are screenplays for cross-cultural feature films)have won awards in China Film Administration’s script competitions.
* The short film “Taste of Home" won the gold medal in the 14th Shandong Short film Competition.
* Co-wrote"Say my name", a short film directed by Ng Chun-Yu and released in 2021.
* Feature Film Screenplay "Lost in years" was short-listed for The Elite project+screenwriting workshop by Wanda Pictures.

_The longlines/synopsises will be shown on the Portfolio page._ ❤️
