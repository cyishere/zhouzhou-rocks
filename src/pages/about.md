Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you here! I am Zhou Zhou, and many of my friends call me Jojo.

I am a Chinese screenwriter.

When I was 17, I received an offer from Beijing Normal University to study film and stepped out of music. That's an incredible four years of film studies as a student. After graduation, I got my first job as a screenwriter. I joined a comedy crew in Hunan. Unfortunately, I failed because I couldn't stand the weather. Then it went back to Beijing to get things going.

I resumed writing screenplays and making short films after producing some commercials and promos to support myself as a filmmaker and writer. Yang Qin's Weekend(a short film)sparked my passion for writing. My friend and I had written some screenplays until 2018, and we were stuck. We started looking for a way out. I am now a graduate student at Beijing Film Academy, where I am majoring in screenwriting and beginning my screenwriting career.

During the process of learning to write screenplays, I've been testing the waters in various genres. More and more, I recognize that I am very interested in the Culture Differences theme and writing Asian (especially ladies) stories. Not only some cultural conflict always appears in my daily life, but it also more and more friends of mine move/immigrate to another country to live, I saw their happiness and struggles in their life, which all touched and hit me deeply.

Since 2021, I've endeavoured to write in English in furthering.

Here are some of the things I've done：（the longline/synopsis will show on the Portfolio page.）

* "Time Difference" and “Beijing Solstice"（both are feature film screenplays） have won awards in China Film Administration’s script competitions.
* The short film “Taste of Home" won the gold medal in the 14th Shandong Short film Competition.
* Co-wrote"Say my name", a short film directed by Ng Chun-Yu and released in 2021.
* Feature Film Screenplay "Lost in years" was short-listed for The Elite project+screenwriting workshop by Wanda Pictures.
