Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you here! I am Zhou Zhou, you can call me Jojo.

I am a Chinese screenwriter. Though this doesn't from the beginning.

When I was 17, I received an offer from Beijing Normal University to study film and stepped out of music. That's an incredible four years of film studies as a student. After graduation, I got my first job as a screenwriter. I joined a comedy crew in Hunan. Unfortunately, I failed because I couldn't stand the weather. Then I went back to Beijing to get things going.

I resumed writing screenplays and making short films after producing some commercials and promos to support myself as a filmmaker and writer. Yang Qin's Weekend(a short film)sparked my passion for writing. My friends and I had written some screenplays until 2018, and we were stuck. We started looking for a way out. I am now a graduate student at Beijing Film Academy, where I am majoring in screenwriting and beginning my screenwriting career.

During the process of learning to write screenplays, I've been testing the waters in several genres. I'm realizing that I'm really into the Culture Differences subject and creating Asian (particularly female) stories. Not only does some cultural clash always emerges in my daily life, but it also more and more friends of mine moved/immigrated to another country to live, I observed their happiness and hardships in their life, which all touched and hit me profoundly.

Since 2021, I've made a conscious effort to write in English in order to advance.

Here are some of the things I've done：

* "Time Difference" and “Beijing Solstice"(both are screenplays for cross-cultural feature films)have won awards in China Film Administration’s script competitions.
* The short film “Taste of Home" won the gold medal in the 14th Shandong Short film Competition.
* Co-wrote"Say my name", a short film directed by Ng Chun-Yu and released in 2021.
* Feature Film Screenplay "Lost in years" was short-listed for The Elite project+screenwriting workshop by Wanda Pictures.
