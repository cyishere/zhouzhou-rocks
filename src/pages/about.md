Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you here! I am Zhou Zhou, you can call me Jojo.

I am a Chinese screenwriter. 

After graduating from Beijing Normal University, I got my first job as a screenwriter. I joined a comedy crew in Hunan. Unfortunately, I failed because I couldn't stand the weather. I finished one season's writing, and then I went back to Beijing to get things going.

I resumed writing screenplays and making short films after producing some commercials and promos. Yang Qin's Weekend(a short film)sparked my passion for writing. My friends and I had written some screenplays from 2014 until 2018, and we were stuck. We started looking for a way out. I graduated from Beijing Film Academy after majoring in screenwriting for three years, and now I just start my screenwriting career.

I've been testing the waters in several genres while learning to write screenplays. I'm realizing that I'm extremely into the subject of Culture Differences and creating Asian (especially female) stories. Not only does some cultural conflict always appear in my daily life, but as more of my friends moved/immigrated to another nation to live, I witnessed their delight and sufferings, which all impacted and hit me profoundly.

Here are some of the things I've done：

* "Time Difference" and “Beijing Solstice"(both are screenplays for cross-cultural feature films)have won awards in China Film Administration’s script competitions.
* The short film “Taste of Home" won the gold medal in the 14th Shandong Short film Competition.
* Co-wrote"Say my name", a short film directed by Ng Chun-Yu and released in 2021.
* Feature Film Screenplay "Lost in years" was short-listed for The Elite project+screenwriting workshop by Wanda Pictures.
