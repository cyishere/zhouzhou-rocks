Hello you! Lovely to see you here! I am Zhou Zhou.

I was born in Hunan, China. MA, I recently graduated from the Beijing Film Academy as a Screenwriting & Film Studies major.

I'm still learning.

I am looking forward to a writing career and have written several scripts.

And I am super excited to finish my short film shooting in August! This narrowing of the gap between visual and screenplay is very beneficial. I hope it will be shown. Yeah！

Back to writing, here are some of the things I've done：

* "Time Difference" , “Beijing Solstice"(both are screenplays for cross-cultural feature films) and " ‘Always Be’, "have won awards in China Film Administration’s script competitions.
* The short film “Taste of Home" won the gold medal in the 14th Shandong Short Film Competition.
* Co-wrote"Say my name", a short film directed by Ng Chun-Yu and released in 2021.
* Feature Film Screenplay "Lost in Years" was short-listed for The Elite project+screenwriting workshop by Wanda Pictures.
* Always Be was selected for the PPP unit of the Pingyao International Film Festival 2022.




*The longlines/synopsises will be shown on the Portfolio page.* ❤️
