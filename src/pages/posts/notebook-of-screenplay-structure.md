Many people produce scripts using the "formula of some screenplay structure," such as Blake Snyder's beat sheet, Syd Field's structure, or Robert McKee's structure; they're beneficial, especially for new writers. You can find the most important and critical points to build the entire plot and how to drive the characters from beginning to end.

I gathered them together in order to find them quickly.

**A. Syd Field's structure**

Syd Field's structure is a three-act structure, as is Snyder's.

**B. Snyder's cheat sheet**

This depicts the main character's actions and changes.

This is the most well-known beat sheet; it indicates when anything will happen.

**C. The five-part structure**

It appears to be a five-act structure, so I dubbed it five parts. BFA taught me.

The professor always emphasized that the climax MUST pay off the entanglements. Quite conducive.

I used the above structures to write some screenplays, and they were efficient, especially when I didn't know where to begin or how to move the story forward. They are tools that assist me in standing.

But, at times, I can feel hemmed in by all that, so understanding when to use them and when to ignore them is critical.
